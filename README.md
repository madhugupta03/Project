## Problem Statement
The data scientists at Big Mart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

## Project Outline
a) Import Libraries (pandas and numpy)

e) Feature Engineering
f) Exploring the dataset:
   I. Dropping columns used for creating new features
  II. Divide into test and train
g) Model building
    I. Linear Regression Model
    II. Ridge Regression Model
    III. Decision Tree Model
    IV. Random Forest
h) Conclusion:
